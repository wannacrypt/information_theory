Encoding, decoding using Shannon-Fano algorithm.

Program:
1) Finds all symbols (not only letters) in the text and computes their probabilities.

2) Encodes the text from the “Text.txt” file using Shannon-Fano algorithm with probabilities from part 1.

3) Decodes back binary sequence into text the result from part 2.

4) Encodes binary sequence with Hamming code.

5) Adds errors to the result binary sequence.

6) Decode Hamming code and fix errors.
